# Technical Project
An API is needed that changes the task status based on a predefined state machine that this task
must respect.
So the workflow of the task: draft → active → done → archived. 

# Overview
* Fully working API
* Well-structured and readable code
* Instructions in the README on how to run the project.
* Writing unit tests
